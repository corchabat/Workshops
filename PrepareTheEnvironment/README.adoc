= How to create a RHEL 8 envirnment with a development subscription using Virtualbox

This How-to is aimed to help you in the creation of a virtual environment for the execution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The goal is to propose a totally operational OS environment that could be enabled with a development subscription from Red Hat.

== Create a virtual Environment for the workshop

=== Install Virtualbox

* Download virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Install and configure the host-only network 
* Go to File/Host Network Manager… or Ctrl+H
* Push the create Button
* A Virtualbox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter will be created
* Select it and configure the ip address and mask

* Then activate and configure the DHCP server

* Now, all the servers which have a host only network interface configured will be enabled to communicate with each other.
* The virtual machines imported in the next steps have configured 2 network interfaces.
- A NAT interface for internet connection
- A Host Only Network Interface for the internal networking, which is required to communicate the control and managed host.

=== Download the RHEL 8x virtual machine


* Download the unregistered applicance from 
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjxeDEQoUvfXmgEVes7JRvcp-Hpc?e=FVQN1G[RHEL 8.1 virtual machine (.ova)^]
* Import the MV to VirtualBox.
* Rename the MV to “RHEL 8 Server”.
* Boot the server
* Login with user: root, password: ltodemos
* Change the hostname to rhelserver

[source,bash]
-----------------
# hostnamectl set-hostname rhelserver
-----------------

* Register the server with your development account. You can get the developer subscription at https://developers.redhat.com/register.

[source,bash]
-----------------
# subscription-manager register --auto-attach
-----------------
* Introduce your username and password with your subscription credentials.
* Update the server

[source,bash]
-----------------
# yum update
-----------------

=== Find out the IP address

Login in and check their IP address issuing

[source,bash]
-----------------
# ifconfig enp0s8
-----------------

Write down the ip for future references.

=== Document the information of the servers

Fill the table below.

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Server | ip address
|=======================

[NOTE]
At this point you have a RHEL 8 server totally operational.
