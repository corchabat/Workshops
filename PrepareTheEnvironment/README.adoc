= How to create a RHEL 8 environment with a development subscription using Virtualbox

This How-to is aimed to help you in the creation of a virtual environment for the execution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The goal is to propose a totally operational OS environment that could be enabled with a development subscription from Red Hat.

== Create a virtual Environment for the workshop

=== Install Virtualbox

* Download virtualbox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Install and configure the host-only network 
* Go to File/Host Network Manager… or Ctrl+H
* Push the create Button
* A Virtualbox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter will be created
* Select it and configure the ip address and mask

* Then activate and configure the DHCP server

* Now, all the servers which have a "host only network interface" configured will be enabled to communicate with each other.
* This virtual machine have configured 2 network interfaces.
- A NAT interface for internet connection
- A Host Only Network Interface for the internal networking, which is required to communicate the control and managed host.

=== Download the RHEL 8x virtual machine

* Download the unregistered applicance from 
https://www.dropbox.com/s/vf205c16y6y9hoa/RHEL%208%20New%20Features.ova?dl=0[RHEL 8.x virtual machine (.ova)^]
* Import the MV to VirtualBox.
* Rename the MV to “RHEL 8 Server”.
* Boot the server
* Login with user: root, password: ltodemos
* Change the hostname to rhelserver

[source,bash]
-----------------
# hostnamectl set-hostname rhelserver
-----------------

* Register the server with your development account. You can get the developer subscription at https://developers.redhat.com/register.

[source,bash]
-----------------
# subscription-manager register --auto-attach
-----------------
* Introduce your username and password with your subscription credentials.
* Update the server

[source,bash]
-----------------
# yum update
-----------------

=== Find out the IP address

Log in and check their IP address issuing

[source,bash]
-----------------
# ifconfig enp0s8
-----------------

Write down the ip for future references.

=== Document the information of the servers

Fill the table below.

[options="header"]
|=======================
|Server | ip address
|=======================

[NOTE]
At this point you have a RHEL 8 server totally operational.

=== Creating a clone

You can now create a clone of this machine for purposes that involve the interaction among servers. 

* From virtualbox select the server recently imported. This server must be powered off.

* Select machine/clone in the up-left menu. 

* Name the new server with a meaningful name to your lab.

* In the *MAC address Policy* pull-down menu select *Generate new MAC addresses for all network adapters*.

* Click *Next* button.

* Select *Full Clone* and click *Next*

* If the server has snapshots taken you can choose *Current Machine State* or *Everything*. Take your choice and click *Clone* button.

* Check the ip address for future uses.

[source,bash]
-----------------
# ifconfig enp0s8
-----------------
