= Notes for configuring loop devices on RHEL

== Description

If the RHEL image is not configured with two extra disks (/dev/sdx) for executing this workshop, you can add loop devices based on files to overcome this disadvantage.

== Procedure

For creating the first disk you can issue the following commands.

[source, bash]
--------------------------
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk1.img bs=100M count=80
losetup -fP disk1.img
--------------------------

Then create the second loop device.

[source, bash]
--------------------------
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk2.img bs=100M count=80
losetup -fP disk2.img
--------------------------

To see the names of the recently created disks, issue the following command

[source, bash]
--------------------------
losetup -a

/dev/loop1: [64768]:41943236 (/root/ansible/disk2.img)
/dev/loop0: [64768]:41943235 (/root/ansible/disk1.img)
--------------------------

Now both devices are present as a regular disks in /dev

For this workshop you only need to change the variables disk1 and disk2 in the playbook: chatbotCreateFilesystem.yml    

Original in the playbook

vars:
  disk1: "sdb"
  disk2: "sdc"
  
New playbook with disk1 and disk2 updated

vars:
  disk1: "loop0"
  disk2: "loop1"
